# POSIX shell script to install a build oil into the proper directory.
# Distributed with the source tarball.

# TODO:
# - copy bin/oil with the right permissions.
# - make dummy man page that points to HTML docs?
#   - or just a cheat sheet for flags, usage, etc.

# Portable install script (configure doesn't always guess right)
# From Python.
#INSTALL=  /usr/bin/install -c

#INSTALL_SCRIPT= ${INSTALL}
#INSTALL_DATA= ${INSTALL} -m 644
# Shared libraries must be installed with executable mode on some systems;
# rather than figuring out exactly which, we always give them executable mode.
# Also, making them read-only seems to be a good idea...
#INSTALL_SHARED= ${INSTALL} -m 555
#
# NOTE: install is part of coreutils.
