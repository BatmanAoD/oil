Bash Completion
---------------

TODO: This directory contains bash completion scripts for Oil developers to
use.  (Eventually these should be OSH completion scripts!)

Usage:

    source completion/oil-dev-completion.bash

    test/spec.sh sm<TAB>    # should complete to 'smoke'
    scripts/count.sh a<TAB>  # should complete to 'all'

It also shouldn't clobber what your distro provides.
